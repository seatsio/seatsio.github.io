import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

**Type**: string
**Default** : empty

The name of the hidden input field that contains the hold token. Only makes sense when a session is active. 

It will be created automatically - you should not create the input field yourself.

The hold token is needed to definitively book seats that were temporarily held. It must be supplied as a parameter to `/book`, `/release` and `/changeStatus` requests for held objects.

Alternatively, you can get the hold token from your JavaScript: `chart.holdToken` also contains the generated hold token - so you don't need the hidden form field generated by supplying `holdTokenInputName`.
