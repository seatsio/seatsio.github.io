## selectionValidators

**Type**: array  
**Default**: []  

```javascript
selectionValidators: [
    {type: 'noOrphanSeats'},
    {type: 'consecutiveSeats'},
]
```

Selection validators run every time a seat is selected or deselected. They check whether there are no orphan seats, and/or whether all selected seats are consecutive (meaning: next to each other and in the same category).

If the selection is valid, [onSelectionValid](renderer-events-onselectionvalid) is triggered. If not, [onSelectionInvalid](renderer-events-onselectioninvalid) is triggered. 

A typical way to use this is to disable the checkout button on your form and to show a warning when onSelectionInvalid is triggered.



## selectionValidators.noOrphanSeats

```javascript
selectionValidators: [
    {type: 'noOrphanSeats'}
]
```

Checks for orphan seats. An orphan is a single seat that's left open.

There's one exception: near the end of the sales, when the venue is almost completely sold-out, we allow single empty seats in some cases. E.g. in the example below, the ticket buyer has to leave an empty seat if he wants 2 seats. In  that case, we don't consider the empty seat an orphan:

### mode

You can make the orphan seats validator less restrictive by passing in `mode: 'lenient'`:

```javascript
selectionValidators: [
    {type: 'noOrphanSeats', mode: 'lenient'}
]
```

In lenient mode, single empty seats are not considered orphans if there's no other way than to leave an empty seat in the current 'block'. Meaning: in the current group of selectable seats that are next to each other:

The default mode is 'strict'.

### social distancing

When you apply a social distancing ruleset with disabled seats to the sides, we automatically enable the orphan seats validator. If you want to disable it, you can do so by passing in

```javascript
selectionValidators: [
    {type: 'noOrphanSeats', enabled: false}
]
```

### highlight

By default, orphans are highlighted by an exclamation mark, and are colored red. If you prefer this doesn't happen, pass in `highlight: false`.

```javascript
selectionValidators: [
    {type: 'noOrphanSeats', highlight: false}
]
```

## selectionValidators.consecutiveSeats

Checks for seats that are not on the same row or not next to each other. Also, it checks for seats that don't have the same category.

```javascript
selectionValidators: [
    {'type': 'consecutiveSeats'}
]
```
