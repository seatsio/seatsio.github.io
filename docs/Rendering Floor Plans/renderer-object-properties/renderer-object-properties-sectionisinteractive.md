**Type**: boolean  
An interactive section reacts to mouse hovers by changing color and showing a tooltip. This is determined by the zoom level: when a chart is zoomed out, sections are interactive. When a user clicks on a section, the chart zooms in, and the sections are not interactive anymore. Instead the individual objects become interactive.
