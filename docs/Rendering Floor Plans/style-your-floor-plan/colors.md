Replaces certain colors of the current color scheme.

Currently you can redefine:

- `colorSelected` - The color used for certain interactive, selected or highlighted user interface elements (e.g. buttons).
- `cursorTooltipBackgroundColor`- The background color for the whole tooltip.
- `colorTitle` - The color of certain tiles, such as in modal dialogs or the Category Filter.

  &quot;body&quot;: &quot;Blue shades are the standard for links and action buttons. They have the unique properties of being easy on the eyes and colorblind safe - less prone to be confused with other colors. Bear this in mind when using other colors that might have less contrast with the background or might be uncomfortable to a percentage of your user base.&quot;
