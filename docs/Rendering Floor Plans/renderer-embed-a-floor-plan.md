You have created a seating chart, and you've created an event for it. Great, youâ€™re ready to show the seating chart to your users.

To do this, you need to: 

1. add an empty div to your page and give it an id. `chart` is an excellent choice.
2. load `chart.js` from our CDN. The URL depends on the region of your account:
   
    - `https://cdn-eu.seatsio.net/chart.js` (Europe)
    - `https://cdn-na.seatsio.net/chart.js` (North America)
    - `https://cdn-sa.seatsio.net/chart.js` (South America)
    - `https://cdn-oc.seatsio.net/chart.js` (Oceania)
   
3. create a new `seatsio.SeatingChart` object, configure it and call its `render()` method

So in short: just copy & paste this code snippet and adapt it to your needs: 

```html
<div id="chart"></div>
<script src="https://cdn-{region}.seatsio.net/chart.js"></script>
<script>
    new seatsio.SeatingChart({
        divId: 'chart',
        workspaceKey: 'your workspace key',
        event: 'your event key'
    }).render();
</script>
```
