You have created a seating chart, and you&#39;ve created an event for it. Great, youâ€™re ready to show the seating chart to your users.

To do this, you need to: 

1. add an empty div to your page and give it an id. `chart` is an excellent choice.
2. load [https://cdn.seatsio.net/chart.js](https://cdn.seatsio.net/chart.js)
3. create a new `seatsio.SeatingChart` object, configure it and call its `render()` method

So in short: just copy &amp; paste this code snippet and adapt it to your needs: 
```html
<div id="chart"></div>
<script src="https://cdn.seatsio.net/chart.js"></script>
<script>
    new seatsio.SeatingChart({
        divId: 'chart',
        workspaceKey: 'your workspace key',
        event: 'your event key'
    }).render();
</script>
```
