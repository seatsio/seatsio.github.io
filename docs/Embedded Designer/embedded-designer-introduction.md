If you&#39;re building a full self-service platform, you&#39;ll want your users to be able to draw their own floor plans without intervention from your own team.

Seats supports this by a combination of two features: an embeddable Designer, and workspaces.   

* The Seats Designer is embeddable: you can embed the designer tool in your web page in much the same fashion as you can embed an interactive floor plan. 

* Workspaces: you can create a workspace for each of your users, so that they have their own secret key, and a separate set of floor plans, so that they can&#39;t see or edit each other&#39;s floor plans. 
Check the [Workspaces API documentation](doc:api-workspaces) for more information on how to create, update and retrieve workspaces.

You can embed the floor plan designer in your backoffice with a piece of javascript, in much the same fashion as you would embed an interactive floor plan for your ticket buyers, but with some different configuration options:
```html
<div id="chartDesigner"></div>
<script src="https://cdn.seatsio.net/chart.js"></script>

<script>
    new seatsio.SeatingChartDesigner({
        divId: 'chartDesigner',
        secretKey: 'workspace secret key',
        chartKey: 'your chart key'
    }).render();
</script>
```
## Secret Key
You need to provide the secret key (of your [workspace](doc:api-workspaces)). Be sure to keep this key a secret: anyone who has access to this key can edit seating charts and can book seats. So please don&#39;t push it to code repositories and only use it in pages served over https.

You can find the secret key on the [workspace settings page](https://app.seats.io/workspace-settings).   

## Chart Key
This is an optional parameter. If you provide it, the designer will load the specified chart in edit mode. If you donâ€™t, a new chart will be created automatically.

You can further configure the embedded Designer with extra configuration parameters and callbacks.
