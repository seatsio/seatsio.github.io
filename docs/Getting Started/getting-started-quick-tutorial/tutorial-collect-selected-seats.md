Your ticket buyer has selected seats on the interactive floor plan. Now you need to pass those seats to your server-side code, so you can later on book them via the Seats API. 

There are 3 options: 
1. using a hidden form field (that's generated by the seats.io code)
2. using a javascript variable on the `seatsio.SeatingChart` object
3. by keeping track of it yourself (not recommended)

### using selectedObjectsInputName
If you add `selectedObjectsInputName:"aFormFieldNameYouChooseYourself"` to the seating chart configuration, the Seats Renderer will add a hidden input field with that name to your form. Note that the div in which you render the chart needs to be embedded in a &lt;form&gt;  tag for this to work. Like so: 
```html
<form id="myTicketBuyerForm">
    <div id="chart"></div>
</form>

<script src="https://cdn.seatsio.net/chart.js"></script>
<script>
    new seatsio.SeatingChart({
        divId: 'chart',
        workspaceKey: 'your workspace key',
        event: 'your event key',
        selectedObjectsInputName: 'selectedSeatsField'
    }).render();
</script>
```
### using chart.selectedObjects 
new seatsio.SeatingChart({}).render(); returns a seatsio.SeatingChart object, that has a selectedObjects property. This is a JavaScript array of strings that contains the selected object labels. Of course, we update the value on each select and deselect. 
```javascript
var seatingChart = new seatsio.SeatingChart({
    divId: 'chart',
    workspaceKey: 'your workspace key',
    event: 'your event key'
}).render();

console.log(seatingChart.selectedObjects); 
```
### using onObjectSelected and onObjectDeselected
by listening to the `onObjectSelected` and `onObjectDeselected` events, you can keep track of the selected objects yourself in your code. 

```javascript
var selectedSeats = [];

new seatsio.SeatingChart({
    divId: 'chart',
    workspaceKey: 'your workspace key',
    event: 'your event key',
    onObjectSelected: function (object) {
        // add the selected seat id to the array
        selectedSeats.push(object.label);
    },
    onObjectDeselected: function (object) {
        // remove the deselected seat id from the array
        var index = selectedSeats.indexOf(object.label);
        if (index !== -1) selectedSeats.splice(index, 1);
    }
}).render();
```
