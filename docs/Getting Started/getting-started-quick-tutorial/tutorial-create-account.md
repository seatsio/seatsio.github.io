First things first: you'll need to [create an account](https://app.seats.io/signup). You can use it for 90 days at no cost to test-drive seats.io.

<div className="text--center" style={{'marginBottom': '19px'}}>
  <img src="/img/tutorial/signup.png" />
</div>

You should pick the region closest to your server. It's where we'll store your data.
The closer your server is to the seats.io server, the faster API calls will work.
