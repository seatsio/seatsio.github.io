An interactive floor plan is only useful to a ticket buyer if they can see which seats are available, and which are not. 

That is what the concept of an *event* is for. 
In seats.io speak, an event is a single instance of a concert, show or sports match. An event is used to keep track of which seat is booked or free; this allows you to re-use the same floor plan for multiple events, without having to go over the design process again.

You can create an event for a floor plan in 2 ways: either through the seats.io web application, or using the [create event API endpoint](api-create-an-event).
