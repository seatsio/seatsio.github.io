Admin users need to be able to perform administrative tasks on events, e.g. 
booking or releasing seats or marking seats as not for sale. 

Thatâ€™s where the event manager comes in handy: it&#39;s a special tool for your admin users, that you can embed in your backoffice application. 

You can set the Event Manager to different [*modes*](https://docs.seats.io/docs/event-manager-configuring#mode), each mode offering different functionality. 

Currently, you can use the Event Manager to: 

* book or release objects
* mark objects as for sale or not for sale
* indicate which tables are bookable as a whole, and which ones are bookable by seat
* manage channels
