import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

To show the event manager to your admins or box office managers, you need to do the following:

1. add an empty div to your page and give it an id (‘event-manager’ is a good choice)
2. load https://cdn.seatsio.net/chart.js
3. create a new `seatsio.EventManager` object, configure it and call its `render()` method

So in short: just copy & paste this code snippet and adapt it to your needs.

```html
<div id="event-manager"></div>

<script src="https://cdn.seatsio.net/chart.js"></script>
<script>
    new seatsio.EventManager({
        divId: 'event-manager',
        secretKey: 'your secret key', // never expose the secret key on a public web page!
        event: 'your event key',
        mode: 'manageForSaleConfig' // 'manageObjectStatuses' or 'manageForSaleConfig'. More to follow.
    }).render();
</script>
```
